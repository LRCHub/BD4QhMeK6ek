[00:38.06] I don't know what it is
[00:40.22] That makes me feel alive
[00:43.17] I don't know how to wake
[00:45.03] The things that sleep inside
[00:46.98] I only wanna see the light
[00:49.71] That shines behind your eyes
[01:03.71] 
[00:55.94] I hope that I can say
[00:57.82] The things I wish I'd said
[01:00.21] To sing my soul to sleep
[01:02.16] And take me back to bed
[01:04.96] You want to be alone
[01:06.85] When we could feel alive instead
[01:22.85] 
[01:16.81] Because we need each other
[01:21.07] We believe in one another
[01:25.32] And I know we're going to uncover
[01:29.69] What's sleepin' in our soul
[01:43.19] 
[01:33.93] Because we need each other
[01:38.62] We believe in one another
[01:42.97] And I know we're going to uncover
[01:47.19] What's sleepin' in our soul
[01:50.90] What's sleepin' in our soul
[02:04.40] 
[02:00.91] There are many things
[02:02.82] That I would like to know
[02:05.22] And there are many places
[02:06.60] That I wish to go
[02:09.09] But everything's dependin'
[02:10.97] On the way the wind may blow
[02:24.97] 
[02:18.06] I don't know what it is
[02:18.94] That makes me feel alive
[02:22.21] I don't know how to wake
[02:23.77] The things that sleep inside
[02:26.11] I only wanna see the light
[02:28.42] That shines behind your eyes
[02:42.42] 
[02:37.94] Because we need each other
[02:42.25] We believe in one another
[02:46.41] And I know we're going to uncover
[02:50.25] What's sleepin' in our soul
[03:03.75] 
[02:55.08] 'Cause we need each other
[02:59.33] We believe in one another
[03:03.16] And I know we're going to uncover
[03:07.35] What's sleepin' in our soul
[03:11.69] What's sleepin' in our soul
[03:15.92] What's sleepin' in our soul
[03:19.76] What's sleepin' in our soul
[03:33.26] 
[03:23.97] 'Cause we believe
[03:28.25] 'Cause we believe
[03:32.56] Yeah, we believe
[03:36.30] 'Cause we believe
[03:41.07] 'Cause we believe
[03:44.83] 'Cause we believe
[03:49.10] Because we need
[03:53.47] Because we need
