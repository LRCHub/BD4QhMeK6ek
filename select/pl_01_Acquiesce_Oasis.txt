I don't know what it is that
makes me feel alive
I don't know how to wake
the things that sleep inside
I only want to see the light
that shines behind your eyes
I hope that I can say the things
I wish I'd said
to sing my soul to sleep
and take me back to bed
he wants to be alone where
we can feel alive instead
<♪>
cause we need each other
we believe in one another
and I know we're
gonna uncover
we're sleeping in our soul
cause we need each other
we believe in one another
I know we're gonna uncover
we're sleeping in our soul
sleeping in our soul
there are many things
that I would like to know
and there are many places
that I wish to go
but everythings depending
on the way the wind may blow
I don't know what it is
that makes me feel alive
I don't know how to wake
the things that sleep inside
I only want to see the light
that shines behind your eyes
<♪>
cause we need each other
we believe in one another
and I know
we're gonna uncover
we're sleeping in our soul
because we need each other
we believe in one another
and I know
we're gonna uncover
we're sleeping in our soul
sleeping in our soul
sleeping in our soul
sleeping in our soul
cause we believe
cause we believe
will we believe
cause we believe
cause we believe
cause we believe
because we need
because we need
